Activity: Installing, Updating, and Removing Software in Windows
-------------------------------
Task:
- Install- You'll install the Mozilla Firefox web browser. There's currently no version of Firefox on the machine you'll be using, so it will be a fresh installation.
- Update- The machine you'll be using comes preinstalled with an old version of the VLC Media Player. You'll update VLC to the newest version.
- Uninstall- You'll uninstall the GIMP photo-editing tool from the machine, removing it entirely.
